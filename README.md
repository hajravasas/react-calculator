# react-calculator
a great introduction to react and node.

### running the app
to get the app started, `npm run webpack && npm start` and then pull up `http://localhost:3030/` to see the functional calculator.

## further improvements
the calculator is only minimally styled, and that is on purpose because my i was focused on react for this app. one day, i may further style it.
